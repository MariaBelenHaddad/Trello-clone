# Trello clone App

Trello app is a popular project management tool designed with simplicity, flexibility and easy to use.

This project recreates My board, with a simplified design for daily tasks. Despite this is an app for teams, the code is front-end developed without data base integration, which allows only one user to work with it.

# Essential features of Trello clone

`Visualization`: My board allows users to visualize tasks in a simple way using cards that can be moved across lists and be organized into columns with different priorities.

`Customization`: Users are free to add and remove cards or lists when they need.

`Personalization`: Change the name of the list to update it.

`Drag and Drop Interface`: It is possible to move cards between lists with drag and drop action to make it more dynamic and easy to use.

# Code

Frontend is made with React and NPM libraries such as react-beautiful-dnd to develop Drag & Drop. The aim of this code is not to develop a full Trello app with Backend and API integration, but to understand the basics of Trello functions for desktop use and one-user management interface.

# Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
